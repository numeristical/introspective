## ML Insights


Welcome to ML-Insights!

This package contains two main sets of tools:

- SplineCalib: Spline-based Probability Calibration
- ModelXRay: Model Interpretability

## Probability Calibration

For probability calibration, use the SplineCalib class.  Detailed documentation is available here:
[https://ml-insights.readthedocs.io](https://ml-insights.readthedocs.io)

Find more detailed examples here:
[https://github.com/numeristical/introspective/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/numeristical/introspective/tree/master/examples)

## Model Interpretation

For understanding black-box models, the main entry point is the `ModelXRay` class.  Instantiate it with the model and data.  The data can be what the model was trained with, but intended to be used for out of bag or test data to see how the model performs when one feature is changed, holding everything else constant.

    >>> import ml_insights as mli
    >>> xray = mli.ModelXRay(model, data.sample(500))
    >>> xray.feature_dependence_plots()
